# facial-emotion-recognitionn

This project is a Facial Emotion Recognition System built using Python. The system captures real-time video input from a webcam, detects faces, and analyzes their expressions to predict emotions. It classifies emotions into categories such as angry, happy, sad, neutral, and more.

The project uses a deep learning model trained on facial expression data, which is loaded using Keras. OpenCV (cv2) is utilized for real-time face detection through Haar Cascade classifiers, and NumPy is used for image processing and normalization. The GUI is designed using Tkinter, allowing users to interact with the system in a windowed environment.

This project demonstrates how machine learning, computer vision, and GUI design can come together to create a functional emotion recognition system
